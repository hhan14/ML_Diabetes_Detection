# ML_Diabetes_Detection
Scientific programming to detect diabetes applying Machine Learning.

Conduct exploratory analysis and will utilize sci-kit learn to train and test
a support vector machine (SVM) to detect diabetes using the diabetes data set from the UC Irvine
machine learning repository. 

Steps taken for the analysis
0. Get scikit learn up and running on your machine.
1. Load the diabetes data set from the UC Irvine machine learning repository.
2. Conduct exploratory analysis of the dataset. Obtain aggregate statistics on each predictor
variable and preprocess data appropriately. Create plots to tell the story of the data: display
the distribution of each variable and relationships between some of the variables.
3. Partition the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Using 2 different kernels (rbf and polynomial), train support vector machines to classify
examples into control (0) and case (1). Select the best model for each kernel and explain
how you chose the parameters you used: kernel, soft margin(C), gamma or degree. Also
record prediction accuracy, confusion matrix and area under the ROC curve.
